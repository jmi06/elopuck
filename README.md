# EloPuck
Chess-like Elo system for the NHL
## About
EloPuck is an open-source data project that provides chess-like elo ratings for NHL teams. A teams elo rating is calculated after each game, their change in elo is based on their opponents rating, the result of the game, and the score differential.

Example: A 13-0 game will result in a larger rating swing than a 2-1 game.

## Live Results
Live results can be found on the EloPuck [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/elopuck.bsky.social) page.
